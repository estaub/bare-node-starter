Boilerplate for setting up a bare-bones node project.
- expects Node 14 or later
- no server (Express et al)
- Typescript 
- commonjs modules
- ESLint
- Jest

The most hard-to-find bit of this config is ESLint for Typescript + Node.  See https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/issues/236.

This is very poorly tested, and only on a Mac.
